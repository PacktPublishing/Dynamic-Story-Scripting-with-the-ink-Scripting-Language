VAR steps = 0

Step after step, you try to make your way to the city. You should not have made the bet that you could walk between the two desert cities with only two days of water. It normally took a week, and it feels like you have been out here alone for longer than that.
You reach for the canteen and shake it. Empty. But you might still be able to make it.
